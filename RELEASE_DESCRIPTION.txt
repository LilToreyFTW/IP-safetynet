================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES:

1. "Advanced features not available":
   - Ensure all Python modules are in the same directory
   - Check that all .py files are present
   - Application will run in basic mode if modules are missing

2. Firewall operations fail:
   - Run as Administrator (Windows) or Root (Linux)
   - Check firewall service is running
   - Verify script execution permissions

3. Database errors:
   - Check write permissions in application directory
   - Ensure disk space is available
   - Database file may be locked by another process

4. Network operations timeout:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify target IP is reachable
   - Increase timeout in config.json if needed

5. Launch screen doesn't appear:
   - Check software-gui-images/launchimage/launch_image.png exists
   - Application will continue with placeholder if image missing
